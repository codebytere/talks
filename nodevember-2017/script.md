## Intro
### Who Am I?
Shelley Vohr, a software engineer at GitHub working on open source. I help build
and maintain Electron, which is a javascript framework that allows you to use web
technologies to build cross-platform native desktop apps.  
### Why Am I Here?
Today, I want to do a deep dive into the mechanics of asynchronous programming in
javascript. To make sure we're all on the same page before I really get started,
I'll go over basic principles of async. Then, I'll get into the timeline of its
development within the javascript ecosystem, and we'll launch into different
methodologies and the nuances of what exactly differentiates them.
