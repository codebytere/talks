**[JSConfEU 2018](https://2018.jsconf.eu/)** - This talk explores the conceptual underpinnings of asynchronous programming options available to modern javascript developers in 2017, and the drawbacks and advantages to each.

**[Node Summit 2018](http://www.nodesummit.com/)** - Approximately three years ago, the first subatomic particles of what was then known as atom-shell burst forth. While it's positioned itself as the essential element of many apps in the ensuing time, it's safe to say that the Electron of 2018 bears little resemblance to its beginnings. I'll discuss the current state of Electron in terms of how we've evolved, our community, and how we plan to drive advancement of desktop runtimes in the years to come. You'll come away with a solid understanding of the role Electron has played and will continue to play in the larger JS ecosystem.

**[Electron Meetup July 2018](https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Electron-User-Group)** - This talk discusses how a small team managed a large ecosystem with bots and automation.

**[Node Collaborator Summit 2018](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/blob/master/2018-10-Vancouver/agenda.md)** - This talk discusses the requirements and pain points around embedding Node and how we can work to improve that in the future.

**[WaffleJS January 2019](https://wafflejs.com)** - Crossword puzzles might not seem like a pastime you associate with anyone younger than baby boomers, but it turns out that the patterns behind these wonderfully nerdy puzzles are a great lens through which to consider different approaches to software engineering. In this talk, Iâ€™ll take you on a journey through some of my favorite clues and puzzles, and how they informed and improved my perspectives as a developer.

**Modern JS /Runtimes/** - This talk describes the process whereby features written in C++ or Objective-C get to JavaScript so they're available to an end-user. It describes how we combined V8, Chromium components, and Node in order to deliver our module APIs.

**[JSHeroes 2019](https://jsheroes.io)** - On principle, Electron is designed to lower the barrier to entry for development and maintenance of cross-platform desktop development. However, beneath the surface of this seeming magic is a carefully engineered web of JavaScript concepts that need to connect in just the right way to make that magic possible. A JavaScript runtime uses a message queue, or event loop, in order to process messages. Each kind of message has an associated function which handles it, and both Node.js and Chromium, which Electron embeds, have different event loops which must be reconciled. This talk will discuss the principles of the event loop as well as the challenges and solutions that Electron faced and arrived at in order to make the synthesis of Node.js and Chromium in Electron possible. You'll get a glimpse into the inner workings of three powerful open source projects, as well as how they leverage and utilize JavaScript for the benefit of users from beginner to expert.

**[QueerJS Stockholm 2019](https://queerjs.com/stockholm)** This talk discussed the tension between human and bot mediated tasks with automation, the work that Electron has done for its own automated processes, and what you may need to consider when choosing to automate a given task or not.
