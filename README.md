## Talks

**[JSConfEU 2018](https://2018.jsconf.eu/)** - This talk explores the conceptual underpinnings of asynchronous programming options available to modern javascript developers in 2017, and the drawbacks and advantages to each.

**[Node Summit 2018](http://www.nodesummit.com/)** - Approximately three years ago, the first subatomic particles of what was then known as atom-shell burst forth. While it's positioned itself as the essential element of many apps in the ensuing time, it's safe to say that the Electron of 2018 bears little resemblance to its beginnings. I'll discuss the current state of Electron in terms of how we've evolved, our community, and how we plan to drive advancement of desktop runtimes in the years to come. You'll come away with a solid understanding of the role Electron has played and will continue to play in the larger JS ecosystem.

**[Electron Meetup July 2018](https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Electron-User-Group)** - This talk discusses how a small team managed a large ecosystem with bots and automation.

**[Node Collaborator Summit 2018](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/blob/master/2018-10-Vancouver/agenda.md)** - This talk discusses the requirements and pain points around embedding Node and how we can work to improve that in the future.

**[WaffleJS January 2019](https://wafflejs.com)** - Crossword puzzles might not seem like a pastime you associate with anyone younger than baby boomers, but it turns out that the patterns behind these wonderfully nerdy puzzles are a great lens through which to consider different approaches to software engineering. In this talk, Iâ€™ll take you on a journey through some of my favorite clues and puzzles, and how they informed and improved my perspectives as a developer.
