#### Electron: Now & Beyond

### Details

**2:25 PM on July 25**
**Day 2 of Node Summit**

### Panel Structure

We will have 35 minutes to talk about anything related to Electron, and the conversation will be loosely framed by curated questions (below). I strongly encourage you to speak to one another during the session, but watch out to not talk over people. The goal here is a group discussion instead of adhering to a strict Q&A format.

### Panelists
**Cassidy Williams** (she/her)
* **Bio:** Currently leads up Developer Voice Programs at Amazon, owner of the todometer Electron project, Glamour Magazine’s 35 under 35 changing the tech industry, and builder of mechanical keyboards.
* **Wants to talk about:** The accessibility Electron provides to the developer community would be good, in terms of being able to build desktop apps with such a universal language (JS).

**Jackie Luo** (she/her)
* **Bio:** Jackie is a software engineer at Square. She previously worked at a startup called Nylas, where she worked on projects like N1, the open-source, extensible email client built on Electron. She lives in San Francisco and spends too much time on Twitter.
* **Wants to talk about:** Performance concerns, ease of web development versus native development, etc. from a developer/user perspective

**Nitish Sakhawalkar** (he/him)
* **Bio:** Nitish is an engineer working on the Desktop Team at Slack in San Francisco. He is very passionate about the web and has been involved in building cross-platform applications that work anywhere from a traditional TV set top box to smart devices. Most recently, he has been collaborating with smart minds for developing the open source electron project. Besides solving cross-platform application challenges, he enjoys listening to Classical Indian music and practicing Reiki healing.
* **Wants to talk about:** Performance, Electron community and open source.

**Shelley Vohr** (she/her)
* **Bio:** Shelley is a software engineer on the Electron team at GitHub who loves figuring out how to make things work. She's passionate about clean code & diving deep into tricky problems with Javascript, Ruby, and C++. Prior to GitHub, she worked at IFTTT, Transloc, and Embedly (now part of Medium). She's also a runner, explorer, and crossword puzzle fan powered by more coffee than a human should probably drink.
* **Wants to talk about:** Anything?

### Panel Questions

Note: The names beside the questions are just so I can make sure everyone gets to speak about their expertise, please feel free to chime in even if your names are not there.
Intro & Warm up (5 mins)

**[everyone]** Would each of you tell us your experience or involvement with Electron?
Current limitations & how to work with them (15 mins)
[Cassidy & Jackie] Panelists that have been involved in applications built with Electron, what other framework options did you consider, and how did you end up deciding that Electron was the right tool for the project? What were some of the trade-offs of using Electron?

**[everyone]** Electron, like all other tools, is not without flaws. Some of the most common criticisms Electron gets is that it’s not very performant, especially when it comes to memory usage. What do y’all think of that? Is that a fair criticism?

[everyone, but maybe Cassidy & Jackie will have real-life examples / tips & tricks from working on electron apps?] On a more practical level, what are some factors developers can control to make their Electron apps more performant?

[Nitish & Shelley] Are there any early architectural decisions in Electron that you'd have changed if you could?
Community (5 min)
[Shelley & Nitish]
Who IS Electron? What are the driving forces behind it?
Electron is built on top of Chromium and Node; how does the electron community intertwine with Node and Chromium communities?
Future & Long Term Vision (10 mins)
About a month ago, the Electron project just had a mini-summit where the collaborators got together and discussed the future of Electron. But before we talk about the exciting roadmap, I want to first ask the two people that were not at the Electron summit, so [Cassidy & Jackie]: imagine a world where Electron is perfect and exactly what you'd wanted it to be, what cool features does this dreamy Electron have that current real life Electron doesn't? Feel free to go wild on this one.

[Shelley & Nitish] What does the Electron roadmap actually look like? What are something about the future of Electron you are excited about?

[everyone] (if “shared runtime” has not already been touched on) now that Electron apps are getting more and more popular, it’s quite common to have multiple Electron apps open at the same time. A lot of people are wondering if it’s possible to reduce resource footprint of these apps by having all these apps all share a runtime. Can you talk a little bit about the concept of “shared runtime” and if that’s possible in foreseeable future? Why or why not?
