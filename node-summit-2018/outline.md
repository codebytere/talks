### Talk Abstract

This talk will center around the development of the Electron project over the last year in three stages. I'll begin with where Electron has been in the past year, then progress to the current state of Electron, then proceed to its future. At each of these stages, I'll quantify and analyze current state in terms of the core maintainer community and its makeup, the state of the project from a feature and security standpoint, the open source model that Electron utilizes, and the ecosystem around Electron usage. The first stage will focus on the history of the project, outlining its beginnings and highlighting primary changes that have occurred in the last year along the aforementioned dimensions. Next, I'll proceed to the project as it currently stands. This will encompass the largest portion of the talk, and will also include a discussion of the cross-company cooperative nature of the project. Youâ€™ll get a glimpse into a model of sustainability and innovation: one involving collaboration and communication between companies to grow a framework and its ecosystem. I'll then outline where we plan to head as we look to the future of the project. The differing needs presented by companies involved in the ongoing success of the project ensure that a variety of stakeholders have a seat at the table for the project's roadmap. I'll discuss the maintainer-oriented, app ecosystem, and technical aspects of this roadmap, and then finally wrap up with a summary of why you should continue to pay attention to this project as it paves the way for cross-platform web language ubiquity.
